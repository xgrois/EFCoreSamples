# EFCoreSamples

Testing Entity Framework Core 5+ and relations with ER Diagrams. For instance:
- Many to many relationships using [classic](CA.M2M.Classic) approach.
- Many to many relationships using [modern](CA.M2M.Modern) approach.

Each folder is a console app where some EFC 5+ functionality is shown.
These apps all use a MSSQL instance that runs in a docker container (Win Docker Desktop). Sensible information is not an issue.
